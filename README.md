Risk prediction of cardiovascular disease and diabetes using retinal images
# Retinal-Disease-Risk-Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes using retinal fundus images. The retina contains valuable information about blood vessels, which can reflect early signs of systemic diseases. Machine learning and deep learning techniques are used to analyze these images and estimate disease risk.

## Problem Statement
Cardiovascular disease and diabetes are major global health concerns. Traditional diagnostic methods are often invasive, time-consuming, and costly. There is a need for a fast, non-invasive, and cost-effective screening method for early risk prediction.

## Objectives
- To analyze retinal images for disease-related patterns
- To apply image processing and deep learning techniques
- To classify patients into risk categories
- To provide an early warning system for cardiovascular disease and diabetes

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Methodology
1. Collection of retinal fundus images
2. Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, noise removal)
3. Feature extraction from blood vessel patterns
4. Training of deep learning model
5. Risk prediction and classification

## Dataset
The retinal image dataset is obtained from publicly available sources such as Kaggle.
(Dataset link can be added here)

## Results
The proposed system successfully predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes and categorizes individuals into Low, Medium, or High risk groups.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of retinal image analysis as a non-invasive and effective method for early disease risk prediction. It can support medical professionals in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

## Future Scope
- Improve accuracy using larger datasets
- Deploy as a web or mobile application
- Integrate with hospital screening systems
